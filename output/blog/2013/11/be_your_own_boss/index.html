      <h1>Be Your Own Boss</h1>

<p>I have been developing personal growth technique for a while. I&#39;ve recently
vocalized it to few people, some of whom found it to be a helpful tool to look
at their own life strategies.</p>

<p>This is really a tactic for iteritave person growth and development. </p>

<h3>Role 1: The Boss</h3>

<p>The first goal it to become your own boss. This is a simple self guided
leadersihp role where you actually listen to that little voice which,
ultimately, knows what you should be doing in many situations. </p>

<p>This also means setting goals and expectations for yourself which are
simultaneously realistic and challenging. </p>

<h3>Role 2: The Employee</h3>

<p>Next, you have to respect yourself as a boss. This means allowing yourself to
submit to your better judgement. When your inner boss makes a suggestion or
sets a goal evaluate that goal and work it into your life as appropriate. </p>

<h3>Steer clear of Master/Slave</h3>

<p>The Catch 22 for many people with this sort of self accountability strategy is
falling into the rut of self abuse. When you fail at a goal you have set for
yourself it is easy to beat yourself up. This gets in the way of everything and
is rarely productive.</p>

<p>Instead of maintaining an abusive Master and Slave relationship with yourself
try to take on the idealized versions of both roles. </p>

<p><em>Be the boss you&#39;ve always wanted;</em> be your ideal manager for yourself. Be
challenging and hold yourself accountable but more importantly be a guide and a
teacher to yourself. Be forgiving when you fail and reward yourself in a
meaningful way when you succeed.</p>

<p>In the same vein, <em>be the employee you&#39;d want to hire</em>. Respect the decisions and
goals which your boss makes for yourself but don&#39;t be afraid to make your
personal and emotional needs to the &quot;boss&quot; side of your decision making process
so those can be taken into account as well.</p>
