        <h1>Why Computers are Straight up Magic</h1>
        <p><em>Post created 2013-11-30 20:03 by Gabe Koss.<br/></em></p>
        <p>Since ancient times there have been specific elements to the archetype of the
magician. Many of these are shared across many cultures and are a common theme
in myth and literature. </p>

<p>Strangely enough these are the same core components which are used in very
practical application in modern computing.</p>

<p><strong>Pop Quiz</strong>: What is being described here? A wizard or a computer user?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I gather elements from the earth and form them in specific shapes and
patterns.  Into this new structure I imbue electrical energy infused with
esoteric words and utterances. Before me, a glowing portal opens and lo, I
can see my friend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>It all starts with energy...</h4>

<p>When you come up against a problem of logic or math the most intuitive approach
one would take is not necessarily lightning from the sky. Okay, I get it, it&#39;s
electricity. But, electricity to solve logic puzzles? How do we manage going to
do that?  </p>

<p>Obviously, we start by gathering the key elements we need to control the
electricity: Silicon, Copper, Gold, Silver, Lead ... </p>

<p>We can&#39;t simply gather raw mineral elements and put them together in
a room with some lightning and expect them to do calculus, can we?</p>

<p>Of course not! We need to take these raw mineral elements and craft them with
symbols that, well not nobody, but not very many people can decipher. Some of
these components are so small and so finite that they can not even be perceived
by the naked eye. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that science doesn&#39;t give us lots of handy explanations for all
of this, but lets face it, very few people really understand the tech they use.
When the mass of the population relies day to day on devices which allow them
to do things which are not practically feasible via other means and they have
no real way to explain what they are experiencing than to wave their hands and
say something about &quot;electricity&quot; and  &quot;the cloud&quot; and &quot;anti-virus software&quot; we
have to conclude that we live in a world right with magic and magic users.</p>

<p>Certainly we have more people alive today who can explain what is going on
under the hood, but imagine explaining this era to a future generation who has
lost the power of computer technology, or maybe the only have the tiniest
vestigial remnant thereof, </p>

<p>So there is only one conclusions they could draw: <em>we live in the golden age of wizards.</em></p>

<p>Arthur C. Clark put it best when he said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll just leave you with that.</p>
