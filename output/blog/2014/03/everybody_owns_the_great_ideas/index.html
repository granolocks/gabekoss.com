        <h1>Everybody Owns the Great Ideas</h1>
        <p><em>Post created 2014-03-10 12:28 by Gabe Koss.<br/></em></p>
        <p>I was driving to work the other day and listening to a show on VPR where they
were interviewing a band called Elbow. They played a sample form a song called
&quot;New York Morning&quot; which had some lyrics that got me thinking. </p>

<p>And, I quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first to put a simple truth in words</p>

<p>Binds the world in a feeling all familiar</p>

<p>&#39;Cause everybody owns the great ideas</p>

<p>And it feels like there&#39;s a big one round the corner</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The line that really got me was &quot;everybody owns the great ideas&quot;, hence the
title of this post. This resonated strongly and simply with me in the context
of the importance of Open Source technologies.</p>

<p>I have always been in favor of deep and broad openness in software as well as
information in general. After hearing this song I began to think of this in
the terms of a philosophical moral imperative.</p>

<p>My reasoning is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Technology is catalyzing profound paradigm shifts for humanity and the world
at large</li>
<li>Paradigm changes have far-reaching consequences for the trajectory of a
species in time</li>
<li>The underlying infrastructure (ie. the Internet) must to be built on an
Open base so that humanity at large can own and control that system going 
forward into the future</li>
</ol>

<p>Open source is about more than simply sharing of information or functionality. </p>

<p>It is about ensuring that the far reaching changes and long term infrastructure
which is being deployed to change the world be made available to both the
present and the future for the survival of the technical systems themselves and
the species-changing transition we are undertaking. </p>

<p>Looking at it from another perspective, I see the infrastructure of the
Internet becoming as fundamental an underpinning to post-modern human life as
an ecological system. I can see few things as dangerous to our future than
continuing to allow the basic components to be owned and privatized such that
the machinations upon which our lives function and depend are obscured from
public view.</p>

<p>Here is the video for the song which got me thinking: </p>
