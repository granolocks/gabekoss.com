# Metasploit on Crunchbang

## Set up Developer Environment

Most of what I do is from the offical [Rapid 7 Development Environment
Guide](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Setting-Up-a-Metasploit-Development-Environment)

### Install any missing deps:

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install \
build-essential zlib1g zlib1g-dev \
libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev locate \
libreadline6-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev git-core \
libssl-dev libyaml-dev openssl autoconf libtool \
ncurses-dev bison curl wget postgresql \
postgresql-contrib libpq-dev \
libapr1 libaprutil1 libsvn1 \
libpcap-dev
```

Other steps that I am skipping for now:

* Install `git`
* Install `rvm`
* Install `ruby-1.9.3`

### Clone Repo

I usually do this into some sort of bin/ directory. I'll use `~/bin` for now.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework.git
```

### Bundle 

```bash
# rvm install ruby-1.9.3-p448
# gem install bundler
cd bin/metasploit-framework
bundle install
```

### Test the installation

Just run `./msfconsole` to make sure that the whole thing working. Yay!
