# Notes & Documentation 

Welcome to my notes and documentation section. A lot of this content derives
from the files hosted in [my notes repository on github](https://github.com/granolocks/notes).

Some of these notes are more complete than others. These docs are _not_
comprehensive, but rather my own personal notes I have taken solving various
tasks over time. 

Unless otherwise specified assume these notes were created on Crunchbang Waldorf.
