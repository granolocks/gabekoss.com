Things rarely go the way that we would like them to in our day to day lives and
all too often we find ourselves forced to deal with large organizations to get
what we need. I often watch people dealing with reps getting frustrated and
angry. This does not help their cause. 

I find that I consistently get good to great customer service from a wide
variety of organizations and I thought I'd share my approach.

## 1: Understand that the Company and the Representative are not the same

This can be the hardest thing for people to wrap their heads around. Even
though someone may be on the other end of the line when calling about a
stressful situation it is imperative that you get the idea out of your head
that *they* are the company. 

The fact of the matter is that they are probably underpaid for what they deal
with day to day, and spend most of their time dealing with belligerent,
frustrated people. If you can suppress your own frustration long enough to be
civil and appreciative anyone you interface with will respond better.

### Bad: 

> I'm fed up with this company. I deserve to be treated better and if you want
> to keep my business you'd better give me what I want.

### Good:

> Hi! How's your day going? I've been dealing with a frustrating situation. I
> totally understand that this is not your fault and I am confident that you
> are going to do everything in your power to help me out. Here's whats going
> on... 

Ultimately you'll get the best response from a rep if you can, without seeming
condescending, treat them as if *you* were the customer service rep and they
the customer. Pretty much the Golden Rule in practice. Try it. You'll see.

## 2: Know what you need 

This should go without saying but is often overlooked. When confronting a large
organization and trying to figure out how to get what you need you first need
to understand what your expectations are for the encounter. If you don't have a
clear objective or know what you are trying to get out of the engagement you
are almost guaranteed to be frustrated.

This can also be one of the hardest things to get right because often people
don't fully understand what they are owed in many situations. Unfortunately
this topic is beyond the scope of this article but there are many resources out
there which define consumer protection laws and can guide you to understanding
what is not only reasonable but, in many cases, your legal right.

When you really don't know what you need the most useful question (after
explaining your situation clearly and succinctly) is:

> So, what can you offer me to compensate for this situation?

This question is good because customer service reps are often trained not to
offer things that they may be obligated to give you in a given situation
without your asking. If you have done a good job building rapport this will
probably get you on the path to being taken care of.

## 3: Escalate as needed

Often times the first line of defense is going to be a very inexperienced rep.
This means they may not know the full extent of what they can do for you or are
too nervous about their new job to feel comfortable going out on a limb to help
you.

The key to escalation is to be friendly and sincere about it. Do not make the
Junior rep defensive or threatened or you will end up dealing with a defensive
superior out of the gate. Instead, thank them and make it clear that you
understand they have done everything in their power to help you.

### Bad: 

> This isn't good enough. I need to talk to someone who knows whats going on. 
>
> Let me talk to your boss. 

### Good: 

> Thanks for trying to help me. I understand this isn't the easiest case but I
> haven't gotten what I need yet to be satisfied. Is there any way you can
> escalate my request to someone else who might be able to pull some strings?

However you treat the first rep will be communicated to the second rep long
before you talk to them. First impressions matter!

## 4: Be insistent

If you are doing all of the above the final step is to be insistent. You need
to understand that you won't immediately get your way but if you persist in not
accepting anything less than having your needs met to the best of their ability
you will ultimately get your way. The smoother you can play them, the better
they will treat you.
