As I began to wrap up the fascinating book _Onto-Cartography: An Ontology of
Machines and Media_ by Levi Bryant I felt compelled to write something on the
subject as I found it both fascinating and accessible. 

_Onto-Cartography_ was released in April, 2014 by [Edinburgh University
Press](http://www.euppublishing.com/book/9780748679966). It is available on
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Onto-Cartography-Ontology-Machines-Speculative-Realism/dp/0748679979)

I was recommended this book by my friend [Harlan
Morehouse](https://twitter.com/harlanmorehouse) as I had been interested in
a number of books he had previously recommended. Specifically related to
_Onto-Cartography_ were Ian Bogosts _Alien Phenomenology_ and the seminal
collaborative collection _A Thousand Plateus_ by Gilles Deleuze and Felix
Guattari (D&G). 

In Alien Phenomenology I was exposed to Object Oriented Ontology (OOO) which
appealed to me as a programmer. There is an intuitive quality of the way OOO
presents existence as non-hierarchical nesting of inter-related objects. This
was a universe in which the human being was not central and had as much
validity of existence as a pencil or a beluga or a black hole. OOO also helped
me voice in more precise terms some of the anthropocentric beef I have with
both the economic and ecological human communities active in the world today.
Anthropocentrism is a fundamental flaw in our long term thinking and even many
people with the best of intentions tend towards a purely self preservationist
approach. 

OOO was not without its problems and I soon found myself scratching my head as
concepts such as Rhizome theory and Nomadology constantly shattered the
simplistic models of "flat hierarchies" I was concocting based on OOO by the
explanations gave for the lines of flow and drift, deteritorialization and
reteritorialization, stratification and double articulation I found in D&G. 

Needing a practical application to grapple with such extreme levels of
abstract thought I began using both concepts from D&G as well as OOO and other
things I have read to attempt to map an abstract schema to use to structure and
index data. Spoiler alert, that isn't the point of this post and I have nothing
to show from that as yet. 

Once while out for a run I told Harlan about my project and he was almost
indignant. It wasn't that he didn't understand it at an intellectual level but
he argued that in many ways it was counter to the overall point of _A Thousand
Plateus_. In retrospect I tend to agree but I think it was a valuable exercise
for me and it resulted in many interesting diagrams as I tried to conceptually
map different objects into Rhizomes or other "structures". 

I was intrigued and having read some of Levi Bryants blog posts it came to pass
that when _Onto-Cartography was released I had already pre-ordered it.
Tragically I didn't have the mental fortitude to read it for several months. 

In the book Bryant lays out the framework for what he sees as tool for mapping
the nature of reality. Hence the so called "Ontological Cartography". He builds
up a very accessible model from the fundamental concept that "everything is a
machine" and every exchange between two machines must be mediated by other
machines; hence "an ontology of machines and media". 

The aspect of machines acting as both individuated objects while
simultaneously as the intermediary medium between other machines, controlling
and manipulating flows is very similar in concept to the ideas of
stratification and the double articulating nature of the interstrata as
presented in the essay "10,000BC: The Geology of Morals" found in _A Thousand
Plateus_.

Bryant explains the machine as medium:

> A machine functions as a medium for another machine not only when it
> amplifies or extends a sense-organ, but also when it modifies the activities
> or becoming of any other machine. Vitamin B functions as a medium for our
> bodies when it modifies our moods. Cigarettes function as a medium for lung
> cells when it modifies how they maintain and reproduce themselves. The
> temperatures of the nest in which a crocodile has laid her eggs functions as
> a medium for those eggs insofar as as it plays a roll in the sex of the
> developing eggs. 

After expanding his views on the base nature of the world as machines relating
machines to machines he continues to expand on many functional topics of the
philosophy. There is a chapter devoted to Bogosts Alien Phenomenology and
another detailing the structure of worlds.

The chapter titled "Machinic Assemblages and Entropy" discusses the way that
machines are joined into the assemblages of which all machines are comprised
(reminiscent of OOO's nested flat hierarchies). Assemblages must constantly
overcome the tug of entropy to decay and break down from their unnatural
structure. Bryant introduces the concept of 'negentropy' and explains that "a
system is negentropic if it engages in active operations to maintains a state
of low entropy across time." He goes on to quote Louis Althusser on this topic. 

> Althusser remarks "... in order to exist, every social formation must
> reproduce the condition of its production at the same time as it produces, in
> order to be able to produce." Human bodies, minds, and affects along with
> relations between humans must be formed or reproduced in various ways in
> order for the city to resist falling into entropic dissolution so that it
> might continue to exist across time. 

Bryant continues to lay out a detailed framework of the different types of
bright and dark machines before arriving at his final chapter titled "Earth,
Maps and Practices". Here he presents his ultimate thesis and the true goal of
the whole book.  

This takes the form of a series of tools of analysis based around the concepts
of Onto-Cartography and also clearly states the main goals of the philosophy. 

Near the end I found one more very relevant connection to a concept found in AI
theory. Specifically this is the idea of backpropagation of values through a
neural network of functions. Simply put backpropagation is the process of using
a functions derivative to determine what sorts of inputs are needed to gain a
desired output from the function. Bryant describes a similar process of
biological backprogation taking place between DNA, RNA and the synthesized
protein. 

Overall I quite enjoyed the read. I still have much to digest and will probably
need to read it again in the not too distant future. 

I would highly recommend _Onto-Cartography_ to anyone who is interested in
language, ecology, gender and race relations, post-structuralism, materialist
philosophy or just curious what I am talking about. I found it to be a great
summation of many challenging works with a very important layer of Bryants own
analysis, synthesis and creative thought added.  What is presented is
ultimately very compelling while still being significantly more accessible than
most.
