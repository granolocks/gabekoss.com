Just to be clear, I did not write this, but I think it is brilliant and want
retain it for posterity.

May your signals all trap 
  May your references be bounded 
All memory aligned 
  Floats to ints rounded 
 
Remember ...
 
Non-zero is true 
    ++ adds one 
Arrays start with zero 
    and NULL is for none
For octal, use zero 
    0x means hex 
= will set 
    == means test
use -> for a pointer 
    a dot if its not 
? : is confusing 
    use them a lot
a.out is your program 
    there's no U in foobar 
and, char (*(*x())[])() is 
    a function returning a pointer 
    to an array of pointers 
    to functions returning char 
```

I original found this [here](http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/90q2/ode.html),
but thought it was worth preserving.
