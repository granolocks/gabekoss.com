I have always wanted to get into 3D modeling. Each time I started in the past I
have quickly found myself intimidated with the cognitive overhead until last
night and this happened.

I went through a couple tutorials and started find myself really getting the
hang of the interface and the tool itself. More importantly I started to grasp
the fundamental concepts involved with creating scenes and how the different
objects can be used to create pretty magical images. 

I really can't take any creative credit for this but I wanted to share what I
made, even though I was basically following some excellent online tutorials
step by step. I did a number of very simple introductory orientation tutorials
which didn't have any interesting renders to speak of. However I did end up
with these two "masterpieces": 

## Glass Cup with Cloth

For this image I followed [this
tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zd1AI198I8) on Youtube.

## "Belgarath" in Ice

For this image I followed [this
tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39-CWSn_kms) on Youtube.

I am excited have made even this modest progress and ultimately what I would
like to do for my first "custom" render is model of the spacecraft from Arthur
C. Clarkes classic Rendezvous with Rama. It's ambitious and I have a lot to
learn before I can even begin to approach something that complex.
