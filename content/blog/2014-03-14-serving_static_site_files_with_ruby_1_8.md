This blog is written using a static site generator called Nanoc. Nanoc is a
great tool to generate fast and stable static sites (like this one!).

I recently created a small Nanoc based wiki type site for a friend.
Unfortunately due to a legacy laptop she can only run Ruby 1.8 so I was trying
to figure out a good way to serve the files. 

I knew that Sinatra could be still be installed on 1.8 without too much trouble
but when i set the nanoc `output/` dir as the Sintra public dir I had to access
the pages by manually adding an `index.html` extension. 

The Nanoc generated file tree looks something like this.

```
blog/index.html
blog/2013/11/be_your_own_boss/index.html
blog/2013/11/introduction_to_elastic_search/index.html
...
````

I assumed I could do this simply enough with Sinatra and this is what I came up
with. 

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'sinatra'

class Ruby18App < Sinatra::Base
  set :public_folder, Proc.new { File.join(root, "output") }

  get "*" do
    unless request.path.split('/').last == "index.html"
      new_path = File.join(request.path, "index.html")
      redirect to(new_path)
    end
  end
  run! if app_file == $0
end
```

Note that I had to redirect paths to take into account the `index.html` files.
