Since ancient times there have been some specific elements to the archetype of
the magician. Many of these are found in many cultures and are a common theme
in myth and literature. 

Strangely enough these are the same components which, in addition to a couple
of key others, go into computers!

#### It starts with energy...

Okay, I get it, it's electricity. Yet, somehow we manage to solve logic puzzles
with that? How do we manage going to do that?  

Obviously, we start by gathering the elements from the earth which we need
most: Silicon, Copper, Gold, Silver, Lead ... The list goes on and on. 

Certainly we can't simply gather raw mineral elements and put them together in
a room with some lightning and expect them to do calculus, can we?

Of course not we need to take these raw mineral elements and craft them with
symbols that, well not nobody, but not very many people can decypher. Some of
these components are so small and so finite that they can not even be percieved
by the naked eye.

#### 5. The Internet



Lets recap, what process am I describing; ancient sorcery or run of the mill
computer technology?
